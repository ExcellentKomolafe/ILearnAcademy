# iLearn Academy – Transforming Minds, Shaping Futures

iLearn Academy is an interactive study platform designed to give students seamless access to curated past questions while enabling educators and organizations to collect valuable learner information.  
Built with a modern React architecture, clean UI/UX principles, and smooth interactions, the platform demonstrates strong frontend engineering, state management, and problem-solving skills.

This project highlights my ability to design, structure, and deploy scalable learning interfaces suitable for real-world educational products.
